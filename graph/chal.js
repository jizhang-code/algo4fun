/*
At a certain tech company there are 40 software teams. 
Each team is composed of 40 engineers 
but no two engineers are allowed to be on the same team more than once. 
The teams all meet in the same room but at 40 different hours during the week. 
In the team room there are 40 work stations for the team to use 
and for individuals to store personal materials to be used during team meetings. 
Show that each software engineer can be assigned a particular work station 
for use during team meetings so that there will be no conflicts of two engineers 
needing the same station in the same meeting.
